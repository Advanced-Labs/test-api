# test-api — AI Working Instructions

## Important: This Repo Is Part of an Umbrella System

This repository is managed through the umbrella repo at:
**https://github.com/Advanced-Labs/X**

All development should go through the umbrella repo, where this code lives under the `api/` directory alongside `ui/` and `common/`.

### If you are working in the umbrella repo
You're in the right place. Follow the root CLAUDE.md instructions.

### If you are working in this repo directly
Be aware that:
- Changes made here may be **overwritten** by the next umbrella sync
- You won't have visibility into `ui/` or `common/` which are sibling repos
- Cross-cutting changes that affect multiple repos **cannot** be done from here
- If possible, switch to working in the umbrella repo instead

If you must work here directly, keep changes small and focused to this repo only.
